  |   Overcooked 2 is serving up more chefs, more kitchens, more recipes,   |
  |   more co-op madness and even more Kevin with the second helping of     |
  |   concentrated co-op chaos!                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Buddy up or go it alone as you cook up a storm, chopping, steaming    |
  |   and frying your way through dynamic and outright crazy levels.        |
  |   Now with online multiplayer for up to four chefs, there is no such    |
  |   thing as too many cooks and the steaks have never been higher as      |
  |   you prepare to save the Onion Kingdom... Again.                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Update/Patch Notes: v1.0.6 (v393216)                                  |

  |   The "Chinese New Year" update includes a new map with seven new       |
  |   levels, two new recipes (fruit platter and hot pot), two new chefs    |
  |   (Chinese dragon and pig) and a new game mode, Survival Mode,          |
  |   in which every dish you serve adds seconds to a timer, and when       |
  |   that timer reaches zero, it’s game over. Finally, a replay button     |
  |   was added to the results screen, allowing you to immediately replay   |
  |   a level.                                                              |

  |   The update also includes several bug fixes and other minor            |
  |   improvements.                                                         |
